Next add in the eggs one at a time, mixing in between. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed throughout the whole cake batter making process.
Next use a sifter or sieve and add in the cocoa powder. You can also add in the cocoa powder to the flour mixture but I usually add it right to the creamed sugar, butter, and eggs.
Mix the cocoa powder in until just incorporated. You don’t want to mix it too much, otherwise it introduces too much air into the batter which can cause large air pockets in the cake when it bakes.
How does a red velvet cake get its color? Take your buttermilk and add the vanilla extract and white vinegar to it. Stir until well combined.
Next add in the oil and finally add in enough red food coloring to get a deep red color. It usually takes 2 to 2 and a half tablespoons worth. Set that red mixture aside for now.
In a separate medium bowl whisk together the cake four, or you can use all-purpose/pain flour, baking soda, and salt.
Next add in about half of the red liquid mixture and about half of the flour mixture into the main cake batter bowl.
After it is incorporated give the sides of the bowl a good scrape and add in the rest of the liquid and flour mixture. You will be left with a completed red velvet layered cake batter, ready to be baked.
Now take two 8 or 9 inch round cake pans and grease them with shortening or butter and dust them with cocoa powder or flour. I also like to cut a round piece of parchment paper and stick it on the bottom. Even though I have non-stick cake pans. I hate it when my cake sticks to them.
Divide up the batter equally between the two pans, and smooth or level off the top with a cake spatula. Or use a butter knife or normal spatula. Lightly tap the pans on the counter or table, this will help settle any bubbles of air that may be in there.
If you like you can soak cake strips in water and then put them around the pans. This helps ensure even baking and helps to prevent mounding of the cake when it bakes. In this case, I don’t mind the mounding, because I will level it and use the extra bits of cake for decorating.
Bake the two red velvet cake halves in the oven, middle rack position, for 23 to 30 minutes or until when you poke them in the middle a toothpick comes out clean.
Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes then remove them from the pans and remove the parchment paper if you use that and allow them to cool on a wire rack completely.
After that you can wrap them in plastic wrap and place them in the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes if you like. The chilled cake is easier to frost, but that step isn’t necessary.
In a medium bowl combine the softened cream cheese, softened butter, and vanilla extract, then mix until well combined.
No slowly add in the powdered sugar until you get the consistency that you want. You may need a little more powdered sugar or a little less. You can also chill the frosting for 30 minutes before frosting the cake.
Take your cakes and level them as needed using a bread knife or cake knife. Set those cake pieces aside because we can use them to decorate the cake, or you can crumble them up, add a bit of frosting and make red velvet cake pops.
Add one cake layer to your cake pedestal or cake board. Then add a generous amount of cream cheese frosting and spread it out evenly.
Next, add the second layer of cake on top of that and continue frosting until the whole cake is covered. There are a variety of tools that help make frosting cakes easier, I usually just use my cake spatula.
You will most likely have frosting left over, you may get away with halving the recipe and then making more as needed. Now place the frosted cake in the fridge and let the frosting sit for 20 to 30 minutes.
