•	Butter –  use unsalted butter, but salted butter will work fine. It gives the cake a wonderful flavor.
•	Sugar – The sugar adds sweetness and texture to the cake.
•	Eggs – The eggs will add structure and moisture to the cake as well as some leavening.
•	Unsweetened cocoa powder – The cocoa powder really makes this cake shine. Amp up the cocoa flavor even more by adding a bit extra.
•	Buttermilk – The buttermilk will activate the baking soda as well as make the cake moist. Don’t have buttermilk? Make this homemade buttermilk substitute.
•	Vanilla Extract – This will enhance the flavor of the other ingredients.
•	White distilled vinegar – The vinegar will react with the baking soda to help the cake rise and create a lighter texture.
•	Oil – I usually use vegetable oil. But other oil will work too, like canola, coconut, etc. The oil helps to make the cake more tender and adds moisture.
•	Red food coloring – You can’t have red velvet cake without some sort of red food coloring.
•	Flour – If you can, use cake flour, if not all-purpose/plain flour will work too. I don’t recommend using self-rising flour for this cake.
•	Baking soda – This will add most of the leavening.
•	Salt – The salt will enhance the other flavors of the ingredients as well as balance out the sweetness.
